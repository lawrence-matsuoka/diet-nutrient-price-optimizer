# diet-nutrient-price-optimizer

## Scrape Atlantic Superstore grocery prices

- Scrape the only the grocery prices
- In theory could scrape the nutrition information and serving sizes directly from atlantic superstore too
- Will have to get the size of the item itself as well

## Scrape Cronometer nutrition data

- https://github.com/bdero/cronometer-scrape
- Must use CRDB since the most information will be there
- OR scrape from Atlantic Superstore directly as well

## Data cleaning

- If taking nutrition information and prices from different sources, will have to consolidate the differences in naming conventions or serving sizes

## Optimization with Julia and JuMP

- Code analysis and optimization with Julia and JuMP
